Sensorial mediation is a term that refers to the use of sensory stimuli to facilitate a state of mindfulness, relaxation, or awareness. A sensorial mediation web app is an application that provides users with various sensory inputs, such as sounds, images, or vibrations, to help them meditate or achieve a desired mood.

Some creative ideas for a sensorial mediation web app are:

A web app that uses binaural beats, which are sounds that create a perception of different frequencies in each ear, to induce brainwave entrainment and alter the userâ€™s state of consciousness. The app could allow users to choose from different types of binaural beats, such as alpha, beta, theta, or delta waves, depending on their goals and preferences. The app could also provide visual feedback or guidance on how to breathe along with the beats.
A web app that uses fractal art, which are images that are generated by mathematical algorithms and have self-similar patterns at different scales, to stimulate the userâ€™s visual cortex and create a sense of awe and wonder. The app could allow users to explore different fractal images, zoom in and out, change colors and shapes, and create their own fractals. The app could also provide ambient music or sounds that match the fractal theme.
A web app that uses haptic feedback, which are sensations that are produced by vibrations or movements of a device or surface, to create a tactile connection between the user and the app. The app could use the vibration feature of the userâ€™s device or a wearable accessory to deliver different patterns of haptic feedback, such as pulses, waves, taps, or rhythms. The app could also provide audio or visual cues that correspond to the haptic feedback and help the user focus on their body sensations.
These are some examples of creative ideas for a sensorial mediation web app. I hope you find them interesting and inspiring. ðŸ˜Š
